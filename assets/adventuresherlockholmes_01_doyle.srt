00:00:21.368 --> 00:00:24.032
The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes

7
00:00:24.032 --> 00:00:26.409
by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

8
00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:30.284
Adventure 1. A Scandal in Bohemia.

9
00:00:32.757 --> 00:00:36.031
I.To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. 

10
00:00:36.284 --> 00:00:40.137
I have seldom heardhim mention her under any other name. 

11
00:00:40.137 --> 00:00:44.773
In his eyes she eclipsesand predominates the whole of her sex. 

12
00:00:44.773 --> 00:00:49.561
It was not that he feltany emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. 

13
00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:52.792
All emotions, and thatone particularly, 

14
00:00:52.792 --> 00:00:58.043
were abhorrent to his cold, precise butadmirably balanced mind. 

15
00:00:58.043 --> 00:01:03.763
He was, I take it, the most perfectreasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, 

16
00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:08.047
but as alover he would have placed himself in a false position. 

17
00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:12.735
He neverspoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. 

18
00:01:12.735 --> 00:01:15.504
Theywere admirable things for the observer 

19
00:01:15.504 --> 00:01:19.409
-- excellent for drawing theveil from men's motives and actions. 

20
00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.096
But for the trained reasonerto admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finelyadjusted temperament 

21
00:01:26.096 --> 00:01:32.238
was to introduce a distracting factor whichmight throw a doubt upon all his mental results. 

22
00:01:32.238 --> 00:01:37.880
Grit in asensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-powerlenses, 

23
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.399
would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in anature such as his. 

24
00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.782
And yet there was but one woman to him, 

25
00:01:45.782 --> 00:01:50.928
andthat woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionablememory.

26
00:01:50.928 --> 00:01:54.310
I had seen little of Holmes lately. 

27
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.393
My marriage had drifted usaway from each other. 

28
00:01:57.393 --> 00:01:59.509
My own complete happiness, 

29
00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:06.614
and thehome-centred interests which rise up around the man who firstfinds himself master of his own establishment, 

30
00:02:06.614 --> 00:02:09.709
were sufficient toabsorb all my attention, 

31
00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.377
while Holmes, who loathed every form ofsociety with his whole Bohemian soul, 

32
00:02:15.377 --> 00:02:18.237
remained in our lodgings inBaker Street, 

33
00:02:18.237 --> 00:02:24.483
buried among his old books, and alternating fromweek to week between cocaine and ambition, 

34
00:02:24.483 --> 00:02:29.629
the drowsiness of thedrug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. 

35
00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:34.880
He was still,as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, 

36
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.522
and occupied hisimmense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation 

37
00:02:40.522 --> 00:02:42.925
infollowing out those clues, 

38
00:02:42.925 --> 00:02:48.733
and clearing up those mysteries whichhad been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. 

39
00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:53.453
From timeto time I heard some vague account of his doings: 

40
00:02:53.453 --> 00:02:57.580
of his summonsto Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, 

41
00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.896
of his clearing upof the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee,

42
00:03:02.895 --> 00:03:10.720
and finally of the mission which he had accomplished sodelicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.

43
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.763
Beyond these signs of his activity, however, 

44
00:03:13.763 --> 00:03:20.933
which I merelyshared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little ofmy former friend and companion.

45
00:03:20.933 --> 00:03:25.792
One night -- it was on the twentieth of March, 1888 -- 

46
00:03:25.792 --> 00:03:31.448
I wasreturning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned tocivil practice), 

47
00:03:31.448 --> 00:03:34.073
when my way led me through Baker Street. 

48
00:03:34.073 --> 00:03:36.868
As Ipassed the well-remembered door, 

49
00:03:36.868 --> 00:03:40.917
which must always be associatedin my mind with my wooing, 

50
00:03:40.917 --> 00:03:44.430
and with the dark incidents of theStudy in Scarlet, 

51
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.074
I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmesagain, 

52
00:03:48.074 --> 00:03:52.358
and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.

53
00:03:52.358 --> 00:03:56.172
His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, 

54
00:03:56.172 --> 00:04:02.188
I sawhis tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette againstthe blind. 

55
00:04:02.258 --> 00:04:05.510
He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, 

56
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.037
with his headsunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. 

57
00:04:10.044 --> 00:04:13.910
To me, whoknew his every mood and habit, 

58
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.183
his attitude and manner told theirown story. 

59
00:04:17.183 --> 00:04:19.573
He was at work again. 

60
00:04:19.573 --> 00:04:25.459
He had risen out of hisdrug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some newproblem. 

61
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.889
I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber whichhad formerly been in part my own.

62
00:04:31.124 --> 00:04:33.737
His manner was not effusive. 

63
00:04:33.737 --> 00:04:37.733
It seldom was; but he was glad, Ithink, to see me. 

64
00:04:37.733 --> 00:04:41.547
With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindlyeye, 

65
00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:45.884
he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars,

66
00:04:45.884 --> 00:04:49.836
and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. 

67
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.862
Then hestood before the fire and looked me over in his singularintrospective fashion.

68
00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:59.937
"Wedlock suits you," he remarked. 

69
00:04:59.937 --> 00:05:05.397
"I think, Watson, that you haveput on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."

70
00:05:05.397 --> 00:05:08.140
"Seven!" I answered.

71
00:05:08.158 --> 00:05:10.909
"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. 

72
00:05:11.031 --> 00:05:14.009
Just a trifle more,I fancy, Watson. 

73
00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:16.882
And in practice again, I observe. 

74
00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:20.722
You did nottell me that you intended to go into harness."

75
00:05:20.722 --> 00:05:23.133
"Then, how do you know?"

76
00:05:23.386 --> 00:05:26.077
"I see it, I deduce it. 

77
00:05:26.077 --> 00:05:30.073
How do I know that you have been gettingyourself very wet lately, 

78
00:05:30.073 --> 00:05:33.686
and that you have a most clumsy andcareless servant girl?"

79
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:38.651
"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. 

80
00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:43.074
You would certainlyhave been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. 

81
00:05:43.092 --> 00:05:49.309
It is truethat I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadfulmess, 

82
00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:54.076
but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how youdeduce it. 

83
00:05:54.076 --> 00:05:57.015
As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, 

84
00:05:57.015 --> 00:06:03.415
and my wife hasgiven her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work itout."

85
00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.274
He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous handstogether.

86
00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:11.910
"It is simplicity itself," said he; 

87
00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.510
"my eyes tell me that on theinside of your left shoe, 

88
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.991
just where the firelight strikes it,

89
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:22.171
the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. 

90
00:06:22.171 --> 00:06:31.026
Obviously theyhave been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped roundthe edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.

91
00:06:31.026 --> 00:06:36.173
Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vileweather, 

92
00:06:36.173 --> 00:06:42.220
and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slittingspecimen of the London slavey. 

93
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.401
As to your practice, 

94
00:06:44.401 --> 00:06:48.150
if agentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, 

95
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.395
with a blackmark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, 

96
00:06:52.395 --> 00:06:55.751
and a bulgeon the right side of his top-hat 

97
00:06:55.751 --> 00:07:00.753
to show where he has secretedhis stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, 

98
00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:05.986
if I do not pronouncehim to be an active member of the medical profession."

99
00:07:06.683 --> 00:07:12.221
I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained hisprocess of deduction. 

100
00:07:12.221 --> 00:07:17.002
"When I hear you give your reasons," Iremarked, 

101
00:07:17.002 --> 00:07:23.324
"the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculouslysimple that I could easily do it myself, 

102
00:07:23.324 --> 00:07:29.684
though at eachsuccessive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until youexplain your process. 

103
00:07:29.684 --> 00:07:33.223
And yet I believe that my eyes are as goodas yours."

104
00:07:33.223 --> 00:07:34.686
"Quite so," 

105
00:07:34.686 --> 00:07:39.527
he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwinghimself down into an armchair. 

106
00:07:39.623 --> 00:07:42.692
"You see, but you do not observe.

107
00:07:42.692 --> 00:07:44.521
The distinction is clear. 

108
00:07:44.521 --> 00:07:45.879
For example, 

109
00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:50.198
you have frequently seenthe steps which lead up from the hall to this room."

110
00:07:50.294 --> 00:07:53.507
"Frequently.""How often?"

111
00:07:53.507 --> 00:07:57.595
"Well, some hundreds of times."

112
00:07:57.595 --> 00:08:00.059
"Then how many are there?"

113
00:08:00.103 --> 00:08:03.298
"How many? I don't know."

114
00:08:03.342 --> 00:08:04.988
"Quite so! 

115
00:08:04.988 --> 00:08:08.554
You have not observed. And yet you have seen. 

116
00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:10.212
That isjust my point. 

117
00:08:10.212 --> 00:08:16.560
Now, I know that there are seventeen steps,because I have both seen and observed. 

118
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.479
By the way, since you areinterested in these little problems, 

119
00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:27.749
and since you are goodenough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, youmay be interested in this." 

120
00:08:28.132 --> 00:08:34.175
He threw over a sheet of thick,pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table.

121
00:08:34.271 --> 00:08:37.588
"It came by the last post," said he. 

122
00:08:37.588 --> 00:08:39.260
"Read it aloud."

123
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:44.441
The note was undated, and without either signature or address.

124
00:08:44.981 --> 00:08:50.676
"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eighto'clock," it said, 

125
00:08:50.676 --> 00:08:56.906
"a gentleman who desires to consult you upon amatter of the very deepest moment. 

126
00:08:56.905 --> 00:09:02.195
Your recent services to one ofthe royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one 

127
00:09:02.195 --> 00:09:08.961
who maysafely be trusted with matters which are of an importance whichcan hardly be exaggerated. 

128
00:09:08.961 --> 00:09:12.787
This account of you we have from allquarters received. 

129
00:09:12.787 --> 00:09:15.459
Be in your chamber then at that hour, 

130
00:09:15.608 --> 00:09:19.639
and donot take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask."

131
00:09:20.298 --> 00:09:24.164
"This is indeed a mystery," I remarked. 

132
00:09:24.164 --> 00:09:26.758
"What do you imagine thatit means?"

133
00:09:26.907 --> 00:09:29.376
"I have no data yet. 

134
00:09:29.376 --> 00:09:33.764
It is a capital mistake to theorise beforeone has data. 

135
00:09:33.764 --> 00:09:37.905
Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suittheories, 

136
00:09:37.905 --> 00:09:40.360
instead of theories to suit facts. 

137
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.260
But the note itself.What do you deduce from it?"

138
00:09:44.566 --> 00:09:49.772
I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it waswritten.

139
00:09:50.181 --> 00:09:54.152
"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do," 

140
00:09:54.152 --> 00:09:58.567
I remarked,endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. 

141
00:09:58.567 --> 00:10:02.512
"Such papercould not be bought under half a crown a packet. 

142
00:10:02.511 --> 00:10:05.550
It is peculiarlystrong and stiff."

143
00:10:05.803 --> 00:10:10.401
"Peculiar -- that is the very word," said Holmes. 

144
00:10:10.401 --> 00:10:14.902
"It is not anEnglish paper at all. Hold it up to the light."

145
00:10:14.946 --> 00:10:20.066
I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g," 

146
00:10:20.066 --> 00:10:24.925
a "P," and alarge "G" with a small "t" 

147
00:10:24.925 --> 00:10:27.363
woven into the texture of the paper.

148
00:10:27.929 --> 00:10:31.620
"What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.

149
00:10:31.769 --> 00:10:36.688
"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather."

150
00:10:36.837 --> 00:10:38.300
"Not at all. 

151
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:44.059
The 'G' with the small 't' stands for'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for 'Company.' 

152
00:10:44.059 --> 00:10:48.751
It is acustomary contraction like our 'Co.' for company. 

153
00:10:48.751 --> 00:10:51.559
'P,' of course, stands for'Papier.' 

154
00:10:51.559 --> 00:10:53.479
Now for the 'Eg.' 

155
00:10:53.479 --> 00:10:56.804
Let us glance at our ContinentalGazetteer." 

156
00:10:56.874 --> 00:11:00.949
He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves.

157
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:05.964
"Eglow, Eglonitz -- here we are, Egria. 

158
00:11:05.964 --> 00:11:11.568
It is in a German-speakingcountry -- in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 

159
00:11:11.568 --> 00:11:15.787
'Remarkable as beingthe scene of the death of Wallenstein, 

160
00:11:15.787 --> 00:11:19.941
and for its numerousglass-factories and paper-mills.' 

161
00:11:19.941 --> 00:11:23.154
Ha, ha, my boy, what do youmake of that?" 

162
00:11:23.154 --> 00:11:28.543
His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great bluetriumphant cloud from his cigarette.

163
00:11:28.639 --> 00:11:32.383
"The paper was made in Bohemia," I said.

164
00:11:32.532 --> 00:11:37.208
"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. 

165
00:11:37.208 --> 00:11:40.995
Do younote the peculiar construction of the sentence 

166
00:11:40.995 --> 00:11:44.940
-- 'This account ofyou we have from all quarters received.' 

167
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.414
A Frenchman or Russiancould not have written that. 

168
00:11:48.414 --> 00:11:52.189
It is the German who is souncourteous to his verbs. 

169
00:11:52.189 --> 00:11:54.161
It only remains, therefore, 

170
00:11:54.161 --> 00:11:59.137
to discoverwhat is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper 

171
00:11:59.137 --> 00:12:02.821
andprefers wearing a mask to showing his face. 

172
00:12:02.821 --> 00:12:08.445
And here he comes, ifI am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts."

173
00:12:08.672 --> 00:12:14.145
As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs andgrating wheels against the curb, 

174
00:12:14.145 --> 00:12:16.809
followed by a sharp pull at thebell. 

175
00:12:16.809 --> 00:12:18.594
Holmes whistled.

176
00:12:18.795 --> 00:12:21.773
"A pair, by the sound," said he. 

177
00:12:21.773 --> 00:12:25.391
"Yes," he continued, glancingout of the window. 

178
00:12:25.391 --> 00:12:28.486
"A nice little brougham and a pair ofbeauties. 

179
00:12:28.486 --> 00:12:31.072
A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. 

180
00:12:31.072 --> 00:12:35.303
There's money inthis case, Watson, if there is nothing else."

181
00:12:35.303 --> 00:12:38.446
"I think that I had better go, Holmes."

182
00:12:38.446 --> 00:12:41.777
"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. 

183
00:12:41.777 --> 00:12:46.492
I am lost without myBoswell. And this promises to be interesting. 

184
00:12:46.492 --> 00:12:48.556
It would be a pityto miss it."

185
00:12:48.556 --> 00:12:50.272
"But your client -- "

186
00:12:50.272 --> 00:12:54.516
"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. 

187
00:12:54.516 --> 00:13:00.167
Here hecomes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your bestattention."

188
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:06.599
A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs andin the passage, 

189
00:13:06.599 --> 00:13:09.237
paused immediately outside the door. 

190
00:13:09.237 --> 00:13:12.615
Then therewas a loud and authoritative tap.

191
00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:15.488
"Come in!" said Holmes.

192
00:13:15.768 --> 00:13:21.110
A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet sixinches in height, 

193
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.349
with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. 

194
00:13:24.349 --> 00:13:31.245
Hisdress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be lookedupon as akin to bad taste. 

195
00:13:31.245 --> 00:13:37.723
Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashedacross the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, 

196
00:13:37.723 --> 00:13:43.509
whilethe deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was linedwith flame-coloured silk 

197
00:13:43.509 --> 00:13:48.715
and secured at the neck with a broochwhich consisted of a single flaming beryl. 

198
00:13:48.969 --> 00:13:52.261
Boots which extendedhalfway up his calves, 

199
00:13:52.261 --> 00:13:55.500
and which were trimmed at the tops withrich brown fur, 

200
00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:01.547
completed the impression of barbaric opulencewhich was suggested by his whole appearance. 

201
00:14:01.547 --> 00:14:04.564
He carried abroad-brimmed hat in his hand, 

202
00:14:04.564 --> 00:14:07.647
while he wore across the upperpart of his face, 

203
00:14:07.647 --> 00:14:10.351
extending down past the cheekbones, 

204
00:14:10.351 --> 00:14:12.375
a blackvizard mask, 

205
00:14:12.375 --> 00:14:15.222
which he had apparently adjusted that very moment,

206
00:14:15.222 --> 00:14:18.313
for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. 

207
00:14:18.462 --> 00:14:22.981
From the lowerpart of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character,

208
00:14:22.981 --> 00:14:25.097
with a thick, hanging lip, 

209
00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:31.113
and a long, straight chin suggestiveof resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.

210
00:14:31.784 --> 00:14:34.174
"You had my note?" 

211
00:14:34.174 --> 00:14:38.941
he asked with a deep harsh voice and astrongly marked German accent. 

212
00:14:38.941 --> 00:14:41.640
"I told you that I would call." 

213
00:14:41.945 --> 00:14:47.439
Helooked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which toaddress.

214
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.722
"Pray take a seat," said Holmes. 

215
00:14:50.722 --> 00:14:54.248
"This is my friend andcolleague, Dr. Watson, 

216
00:14:54.248 --> 00:14:57.436
who is occasionally good enough to help mein my cases. 

217
00:14:57.436 --> 00:15:00.318
Whom have I the honour to address?"

218
00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:05.777
"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.

219
00:15:05.874 --> 00:15:12.078
I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honourand discretion, 

220
00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:16.780
whom I may trust with a matter of the mostextreme importance. 

221
00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:21.673
If not, I should much prefer to communicatewith you alone."

222
00:15:22.161 --> 00:15:27.176
I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed meback into my chair. 

223
00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:30.742
"It is both, or none," said he. 

224
00:15:30.742 --> 00:15:35.060
"You may saybefore this gentleman anything which you may say to me."

225
00:15:35.313 --> 00:15:38.169
The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. 

226
00:15:38.369 --> 00:15:41.373
"Then I must begin," saidhe, 

227
00:15:41.373 --> 00:15:46.155
"by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; 

228
00:15:46.155 --> 00:15:51.066
atthe end of that time the matter will be of no importance. 

229
00:15:51.066 --> 00:15:55.637
Atpresent it is not too much to say that it is of such weight 

230
00:15:55.637 --> 00:15:59.903
itmay have an influence upon European history."

231
00:16:00.026 --> 00:16:04.527
"I promise," said Holmes."And I."

232
00:16:04.884 --> 00:16:09.873
"You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. 

233
00:16:09.873 --> 00:16:15.420
"Theaugust person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown toyou, 

234
00:16:15.542 --> 00:16:22.342
and I may confess at once that the title by which I havejust called myself is not exactly my own."

235
00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.652
"I was aware of it," said Holmes dryly.

236
00:16:27.219 --> 00:16:30.837
"The circumstances are of great delicacy, 

237
00:16:30.837 --> 00:16:36.700
and every precautionhas to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immensescandal 

238
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.436
and seriously compromise one of the reigning families ofEurope. 

239
00:16:40.436 --> 00:16:46.210
To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great Houseof Ormstein, 

240
00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.848
hereditary kings of Bohemia."

241
00:16:48.893 --> 00:16:52.302
"I was also aware of that," 

242
00:16:52.302 --> 00:16:57.247
murmured Holmes, settling himselfdown in his armchair and closing his eyes.

243
00:16:57.391 --> 00:17:05.541
Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him

244
00:17:05.541 --> 00:17:10.329
as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe.

245
00:17:10.687 --> 00:17:16.852
Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at hisgigantic client.

246
00:17:16.852 --> 00:17:21.554
"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case," 

247
00:17:21.554 --> 00:17:25.349
heremarked, "I should be better able to advise you."

248
00:17:25.759 --> 00:17:31.715
The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room inuncontrollable agitation. 

249
00:17:31.715 --> 00:17:37.763
Then, with a gesture of desperation, hetore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. 

250
00:17:37.763 --> 00:17:40.284
"Youare right," he cried; 

251
00:17:40.284 --> 00:17:44.445
"I am the King. Why should I attempt toconceal it?"

252
00:17:44.541 --> 00:17:47.676
"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes. 

253
00:17:47.676 --> 00:17:55.773
"Your Majesty had not spokenbefore I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm GottsreichSigismond von Ormstein, 

254
00:17:55.773 --> 00:18:01.215
Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, andhereditary King of Bohemia."

255
00:18:01.704 --> 00:18:03.924
"But you can understand," 

256
00:18:03.924 --> 00:18:05.466
said our strange visitor, 

257
00:18:05.466 --> 00:18:10.150
sitting downonce more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, 

258
00:18:10.194 --> 00:18:16.184
"youcan understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business inmy own person. 

259
00:18:16.202 --> 00:18:18.592
Yet the matter was so delicate 

260
00:18:18.592 --> 00:18:22.937
that I could notconfide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. 

261
00:18:23.137 --> 00:18:27.848
Ihave come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consultingyou."

262
00:18:28.349 --> 00:18:30.857
"Then, pray consult," 

263
00:18:30.857 --> 00:18:33.869
said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.

264
00:18:34.409 --> 00:18:37.309
"The facts are briefly these: 

265
00:18:37.309 --> 00:18:41.763
Some five years ago, during alengthy visit to Warsaw, 

266
00:18:41.763 --> 00:18:46.843
I made the acquaintance of the well-knownadventuress, Irene Adler. 

267
00:18:46.843 --> 00:18:50.091
The name is no doubt familiar to you."

268
00:18:50.631 --> 00:18:53.792
"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor," 

269
00:18:53.792 --> 00:18:56.979
murmured Holmes withoutopening his eyes. 

270
00:18:56.979 --> 00:19:03.196
For many years he had adopted a system ofdocketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, 

271
00:19:03.196 --> 00:19:09.813
so that itwas difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could notat once furnish information. 

272
00:19:10.093 --> 00:19:15.657
In this case I found her biographysandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi 

273
00:19:15.657 --> 00:19:20.706
and that of astaff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-seafishes.

274
00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:25.095
"Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum! 

275
00:19:25.095 --> 00:19:29.397
Born in New Jersey in the year1858. 

276
00:19:29.397 --> 00:19:34.308
Contralto -- hum! La Scala, hum! 

277
00:19:34.308 --> 00:19:38.932
Prima donna Imperial Operaof Warsaw -- yes! 

278
00:19:38.932 --> 00:19:42.406
Retired from operatic stage -- ha! 

279
00:19:42.406 --> 00:19:45.183
Living inLondon -- quite so! 

280
00:19:45.201 --> 00:19:50.778
Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangledwith this young person, 

281
00:19:50.778 --> 00:19:56.846
wrote her some compromising letters, andis now desirous of getting those letters back."

282
00:19:57.061 --> 00:20:00.090
"Precisely so. But how -- "

283
00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.337
"Was there a secret marriage?"

284
00:20:02.337 --> 00:20:08.118
"None.""No legal papers or certificates?""None."

285
00:20:08.292 --> 00:20:11.140
"Then I fail to follow your Majesty. 

286
00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:16.235
If this young person shouldproduce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, 

287
00:20:16.235 --> 00:20:19.430
how isshe to prove their authenticity?"

288
00:20:19.683 --> 00:20:21.755
"There is the writing."

289
00:20:21.755 --> 00:20:24.767
"Pooh, pooh! Forgery."

290
00:20:24.889 --> 00:20:28.868
"My private note-paper.""Stolen."

291
00:20:28.912 --> 00:20:32.813
"My own seal.""Imitated."

292
00:20:33.013 --> 00:20:36.078
"My photograph.""Bought."

293
00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:39.087
"We were both in the photograph."

294
00:20:39.087 --> 00:20:43.193
"Oh, dear! That is very bad! 

295
00:20:43.193 --> 00:20:46.780
Your Majesty has indeed committed anindiscretion."

296
00:20:47.215 --> 00:20:50.541
"I was mad -- insane."

297
00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:54.068
"You have compromised yourself seriously."

298
00:20:54.191 --> 00:20:57.090
"I was only Crown Prince then. 

299
00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:00.285
I was young. I am but thirty now."

300
00:21:00.486 --> 00:21:02.767
"It must be recovered."

301
00:21:02.863 --> 00:21:05.588
"We have tried and failed."

302
00:21:05.763 --> 00:21:09.720
"Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought."

303
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.635
"She will not sell."

304
00:21:11.797 --> 00:21:13.626
"Stolen, then."

305
00:21:13.626 --> 00:21:16.055
"Five attempts have been made. 

306
00:21:16.055 --> 00:21:20.104
Twice burglars in my pay ransackedher house. 

307
00:21:20.104 --> 00:21:23.239
Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. 

308
00:21:23.239 --> 00:21:25.407
Twiceshe has been waylaid. 

309
00:21:25.407 --> 00:21:27.661
There has been no result."

310
00:21:27.679 --> 00:21:29.620
"No sign of it?"

311
00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:32.032
"Absolutely none."

312
00:21:32.355 --> 00:21:34.184
Holmes laughed. 

313
00:21:34.228 --> 00:21:37.972
"It is quite a pretty little problem," said he.

314
00:21:39.087 --> 00:21:44.659
"But a very serious one to me," returned the King reproachfully.

315
00:21:44.755 --> 00:21:50.189
"Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with thephotograph?"

316
00:21:50.189 --> 00:21:53.593
"To ruin me.""But how?"

317
00:21:53.898 --> 00:21:56.754
"I am about to be married."

318
00:21:56.798 --> 00:21:59.018
"So I have heard."

319
00:21:59.018 --> 00:22:06.288
"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of theKing of Scandinavia. 

320
00:22:06.306 --> 00:22:09.781
You may know the strict principles of herfamily. 

321
00:22:09.781 --> 00:22:13.634
She is herself the very soul of delicacy. 

322
00:22:13.634 --> 00:22:18.840
A shadow of adoubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end."

323
00:22:19.093 --> 00:22:21.400
"And Irene Adler?"

324
00:22:21.757 --> 00:22:24.853
"Threatens to send them the photograph. 

325
00:22:24.853 --> 00:22:28.601
And she will do it. Iknow that she will do it. 

326
00:22:28.601 --> 00:22:32.219
You do not know her, but she has a soulof steel. 

327
00:22:32.219 --> 00:22:35.075
She has the face of the most beautiful of women, 

328
00:22:35.075 --> 00:22:38.297
andthe mind of the most resolute of men. 

329
00:22:38.297 --> 00:22:44.626
Rather than I should marryanother woman, there are no lengths to which she would notgo -- none."

330
00:22:45.088 --> 00:22:50.060
"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?""I am sure."

331
00:22:50.801 --> 00:22:52.473
"And why?"

332
00:22:52.577 --> 00:22:59.004
"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when thebetrothal was publicly proclaimed. 

333
00:22:59.004 --> 00:23:01.041
That will be next Monday."

334
00:23:01.041 --> 00:23:06.736
"Oh, then we have three days yet," said Holmes with a yawn. 

335
00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:13.214
"Thatis very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance tolook into just at present. 

336
00:23:13.232 --> 00:23:17.237
Your Majesty will, of course, stay inLondon for the present?"

337
00:23:17.342 --> 00:23:19.039
"Certainly. 

338
00:23:19.039 --> 00:23:23.567
You will find me at the Langham under the name of theCount Von Kramm."

339
00:23:24.212 --> 00:23:28.862
"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress."

340
00:23:28.862 --> 00:23:32.919
"Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety."

341
00:23:33.067 --> 00:23:35.975
"Then, as to money?"

342
00:23:36.411 --> 00:23:39.031
"You have carte blanche."

343
00:23:39.031 --> 00:23:40.773
"Absolutely?"

344
00:23:41.105 --> 00:23:46.546
"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdomto have that photograph."

345
00:23:46.695 --> 00:23:49.634
"And for present expenses?"

346
00:23:49.634 --> 00:23:55.023
The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloakand laid it on the table.

347
00:23:55.271 --> 00:24:01.201
"There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred innotes," he said.

348
00:24:01.201 --> 00:24:05.990
Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book andhanded it to him.

349
00:24:06.556 --> 00:24:10.117
"And Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.

350
00:24:10.213 --> 00:24:15.681
"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."

351
00:24:15.882 --> 00:24:18.215
Holmes took a note of it. 

352
00:24:18.311 --> 00:24:21.394
"One other question," said he. 

353
00:24:21.394 --> 00:24:24.372
"Was thephotograph a cabinet?"

354
00:24:24.372 --> 00:24:25.939
"It was."

355
00:24:25.939 --> 00:24:28.342
"Then, good-night, your Majesty, 

356
00:24:28.342 --> 00:24:32.287
and I trust that we shall soonhave some good news for you. 

357
00:24:32.287 --> 00:24:34.337
And good-night, Watson," 

358
00:24:34.337 --> 00:24:38.635
he added,as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. 

359
00:24:38.635 --> 00:24:43.102
"Ifyou will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at threeo'clock 

360
00:24:43.102 --> 00:24:46.767
I should like to chat this little matter over with you."

361
00:24:47.281 --> 00:24:49.379
II.

362
00:24:50.703 --> 00:24:56.745
At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes hadnot yet returned. 

363
00:24:56.894 --> 00:25:02.257
The landlady informed me that he had left thehouse shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. 

364
00:25:02.432 --> 00:25:08.866
I sat downbeside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him,however long he might be. 

365
00:25:08.962 --> 00:25:12.018
I was already deeply interested in hisinquiry, 

366
00:25:12.018 --> 00:25:20.469
for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim andstrange features which were associated with the two crimes whichI have already recorded, 

367
00:25:20.469 --> 00:25:27.770
still, the nature of the case and theexalted station of his client gave it a character of its own.

368
00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:33.393
Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which myfriend had on hand, 

369
00:25:33.393 --> 00:25:37.206
there was something in his masterly grasp ofa situation, 

370
00:25:37.206 --> 00:25:40.093
and his keen, incisive reasoning, 

371
00:25:40.093 --> 00:25:43.711
which made it apleasure to me to study his system of work, 

372
00:25:43.711 --> 00:25:50.464
and to follow thequick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the mostinextricable mysteries. 

373
00:25:50.464 --> 00:25:58.570
So accustomed was I to his invariablesuccess that the very possibility of his failing had ceased toenter into my head.

374
00:25:58.875 --> 00:26:02.441
It was close upon four before the door opened, 

375
00:26:02.441 --> 00:26:06.372
and adrunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, 

376
00:26:06.372 --> 00:26:11.161
with aninflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room.

377
00:26:11.649 --> 00:26:17.134
Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use ofdisguises, 

378
00:26:17.134 --> 00:26:22.314
I had to look three times before I was certain that itwas indeed he. 

379
00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.984
With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, 

380
00:26:24.984 --> 00:26:29.982
whence heemerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old.

381
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:38.020
Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs infront of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.

382
00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.919
"Well, really!" he cried, 

383
00:26:40.919 --> 00:26:47.606
and then he choked and laughed againuntil he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in thechair.

384
00:26:47.606 --> 00:26:49.522
"What is it?"

385
00:26:49.644 --> 00:26:51.708
"It's quite too funny. 

386
00:26:51.708 --> 00:26:56.358
I am sure you could never guess how Iemployed my morning, 

387
00:26:56.358 --> 00:26:58.534
or what I ended by doing."

388
00:26:58.656 --> 00:27:00.655
"I can't imagine. 

389
00:27:00.673 --> 00:27:07.473
I suppose that you have been watching thehabits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler."

390
00:27:07.778 --> 00:27:11.383
"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. 

391
00:27:11.383 --> 00:27:13.442
I will tell you,however. 

392
00:27:13.442 --> 00:27:19.353
I left the house a little after eight o'clock thismorning in the character of a groom out of work. 

393
00:27:19.502 --> 00:27:23.969
There is awonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. 

394
00:27:23.969 --> 00:27:28.213
Be one ofthem, and you will know all that there is to know. 

395
00:27:28.213 --> 00:27:30.982
I soon foundBriony Lodge. 

396
00:27:30.982 --> 00:27:34.496
It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, 

397
00:27:34.496 --> 00:27:38.049
butbuilt out in front right up to the road, two stories. 

398
00:27:38.049 --> 00:27:39.956
Chubb lockto the door. 

399
00:27:39.956 --> 00:27:42.359
Large sitting-room on the right side, 

400
00:27:42.359 --> 00:27:46.233
wellfurnished, with long windows almost to the floor, 

401
00:27:46.356 --> 00:27:51.380
and thosepreposterous English window fasteners which a child could open.

402
00:27:51.397 --> 00:27:57.876
Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage windowcould be reached from the top of the coach-house. 

403
00:27:57.876 --> 00:28:02.160
I walked roundit and examined it closely from every point of view, 

404
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.407
but withoutnoting anything else of interest.

405
00:28:05.948 --> 00:28:10.702
"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, 

406
00:28:10.702 --> 00:28:15.286
thatthere was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of thegarden. 

407
00:28:15.286 --> 00:28:19.048
I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses,

408
00:28:19.048 --> 00:28:23.580
and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, 

409
00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.683
twofills of shag tobacco, 

410
00:28:25.683 --> 00:28:29.653
and as much information as I could desireabout Miss Adler, 

411
00:28:29.653 --> 00:28:32.984
to say nothing of half a dozen other people inthe neighbourhood 

412
00:28:32.984 --> 00:28:35.727
in whom I was not in the least interested, 

413
00:28:35.727 --> 00:28:38.896
butwhose biographies I was compelled to listen to."

414
00:28:39.227 --> 00:28:43.180
"And what of Irene Adler?" I asked.

415
00:28:43.277 --> 00:28:47.509
"Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. 

416
00:28:47.509 --> 00:28:51.296
She isthe daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. 

417
00:28:51.296 --> 00:28:54.535
So say theSerpentine-mews, to a man. 

418
00:28:54.535 --> 00:28:58.088
She lives quietly, sings at concerts,

419
00:28:58.088 --> 00:29:02.903
drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp fordinner. 

420
00:29:02.903 --> 00:29:06.630
Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings.

421
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:10.300
Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. 

422
00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:13.109
He is dark,handsome, and dashing, 

423
00:29:13.109 --> 00:29:17.066
never calls less than once a day, andoften twice. 

424
00:29:17.066 --> 00:29:21.332
He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. 

425
00:29:21.572 --> 00:29:25.151
Seethe advantages of a cabman as a confidant. 

426
00:29:25.151 --> 00:29:31.720
They had driven himhome a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him.

427
00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.555
When I had listened to all they had to tell, 

428
00:29:34.555 --> 00:29:38.212
I began to walk upand down near Briony Lodge once more, 

429
00:29:38.212 --> 00:29:40.890
and to think over my planof campaign.

430
00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:46.906
"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in thematter. 

431
00:29:46.924 --> 00:29:50.516
He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. 

432
00:29:50.516 --> 00:29:52.945
What was therelation between them, 

433
00:29:52.945 --> 00:29:56.406
and what the object of his repeatedvisits? 

434
00:29:56.406 --> 00:30:01.448
Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? 

435
00:30:01.448 --> 00:30:06.346
If theformer, she had probably transferred the photograph to hiskeeping. 

436
00:30:06.346 --> 00:30:09.559
If the latter, it was less likely. 

437
00:30:09.559 --> 00:30:15.071
On the issue of thisquestion depended whether I should continue my work at BrionyLodge, 

438
00:30:15.071 --> 00:30:18.846
or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in theTemple. 

439
00:30:18.846 --> 00:30:21.079
It was a delicate point, 

440
00:30:21.079 --> 00:30:23.731
and it widened the field of myinquiry. 

441
00:30:23.731 --> 00:30:26.800
I fear that I bore you with these details, 

442
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.882
but I have tolet you see my little difficulties, 

443
00:30:29.882 --> 00:30:32.660
if you are to understand thesituation."

444
00:30:32.886 --> 00:30:36.944
"I am following you closely," I answered.

445
00:30:37.824 --> 00:30:44.119
"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cabdrove up to Briony Lodge, 

446
00:30:44.119 --> 00:30:46.104
and a gentleman sprang out. 

447
00:30:46.104 --> 00:30:48.664
He was aremarkably handsome man, 

448
00:30:48.664 --> 00:30:51.564
dark, aquiline, and moustached 

449
00:30:51.564 --> 00:30:54.202
-- evidentlythe man of whom I had heard. 

450
00:30:54.202 --> 00:30:56.841
He appeared to be in agreat hurry, 

451
00:30:56.841 --> 00:30:59.087
shouted to the cabman to wait, 

452
00:30:59.087 --> 00:31:04.137
and brushed past themaid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughlyat home.

453
00:31:04.547 --> 00:31:06.780
"He was in the house about half an hour, 

454
00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:10.607
and I could catchglimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, 

455
00:31:10.607 --> 00:31:13.951
pacing up anddown, talking excitedly, 

456
00:31:13.951 --> 00:31:15.780
and waving his arms. 

457
00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:18.374
Of her I could seenothing. 

458
00:31:18.392 --> 00:31:22.762
Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried thanbefore. 

459
00:31:22.884 --> 00:31:25.026
As he stepped up to the cab, 

460
00:31:25.026 --> 00:31:28.735
he pulled a gold watch fromhis pocket and looked at it earnestly, 

461
00:31:28.735 --> 00:31:31.974
'Drive like the devil,' heshouted, 

462
00:31:31.974 --> 00:31:34.927
'first to Gross &amp; Hankey's in Regent Street, 

463
00:31:34.927 --> 00:31:38.637
and then tothe Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. 

464
00:31:38.637 --> 00:31:41.649
Half a guinea ifyou do it in twenty minutes!'

465
00:31:41.667 --> 00:31:43.665
"Away they went, 

466
00:31:43.665 --> 00:31:47.597
and I was just wondering whether I should not dowell to follow them 

467
00:31:47.597 --> 00:31:50.614
when up the lane came a neat little landau,

468
00:31:50.614 --> 00:31:55.616
the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie underhis ear, 

469
00:31:55.616 --> 00:31:59.482
while all the tags of his harness were sticking out ofthe buckles. 

470
00:31:59.482 --> 00:32:03.779
It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the halldoor and into it. 

471
00:32:03.779 --> 00:32:07.842
I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment,but she was a lovely woman, 

472
00:32:07.842 --> 00:32:10.462
with a face that a man might die for.

473
00:32:10.872 --> 00:32:14.555
'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she cried, 

474
00:32:14.555 --> 00:32:18.064
'and half asovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'

475
00:32:18.604 --> 00:32:21.556
"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. 

476
00:32:21.556 --> 00:32:24.769
I was just balancingwhether I should run for it, 

477
00:32:24.769 --> 00:32:27.224
or whether I should perch behind herlandau 

478
00:32:27.224 --> 00:32:29.483
when a cab came through the street. 

479
00:32:29.483 --> 00:32:34.642
The driver lookedtwice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he couldobject. 

480
00:32:34.642 --> 00:32:37.334
'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 

481
00:32:37.334 --> 00:32:40.625
'and half a sovereignif you reach it in twenty minutes.' 

482
00:32:40.625 --> 00:32:45.902
It was twenty-five minutes totwelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.

483
00:32:45.972 --> 00:32:48.467
"My cabby drove fast. 

484
00:32:48.467 --> 00:32:50.909
I don't think I ever drove faster, 

485
00:32:50.909 --> 00:32:53.391
but theothers were there before us. 

486
00:32:53.391 --> 00:32:58.864
The cab and the landau with theirsteaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. 

487
00:32:58.864 --> 00:33:02.038
I paidthe man and hurried into the church. 

488
00:33:02.038 --> 00:33:05.773
There was not a soul theresave the two whom I had followed 

489
00:33:05.773 --> 00:33:10.509
and a surpliced clergyman, whoseemed to be expostulating with them. 

490
00:33:10.509 --> 00:33:14.309
They were all threestanding in a knot in front of the altar. 

491
00:33:14.326 --> 00:33:19.616
I lounged up the sideaisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church.

492
00:33:19.616 --> 00:33:24.501
Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round tome, 

493
00:33:24.501 --> 00:33:28.563
and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towardsme.

494
00:33:28.563 --> 00:33:33.169
'Thank God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'

495
00:33:33.474 --> 00:33:36.139
'What then?' I asked.

496
00:33:36.139 --> 00:33:40.697
'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'

497
00:33:40.697 --> 00:33:43.623
"I was half-dragged up to the altar, 

498
00:33:43.623 --> 00:33:45.713
and before I knew where I was

499
00:33:45.713 --> 00:33:49.798
I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear,

500
00:33:49.798 --> 00:33:52.828
and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, 

501
00:33:52.828 --> 00:34:00.751
and generallyassisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, toGodfrey Norton, bachelor. 

502
00:34:01.004 --> 00:34:03.498
It was all done in an instant, 

503
00:34:03.498 --> 00:34:08.527
andthere was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the ladyon the other, 

504
00:34:08.527 --> 00:34:11.426
while the clergyman beamed on me in front. 

505
00:34:11.426 --> 00:34:14.469
It wasthe most preposterous position 

506
00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:17.381
in which I ever found myself in mylife, 

507
00:34:17.381 --> 00:34:21.482
and it was the thought of it that started me laughing justnow. 

508
00:34:21.482 --> 00:34:26.082
It seems that there had been some informality about theirlicense, 

509
00:34:26.082 --> 00:34:31.319
that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry themwithout a witness of some sort, 

510
00:34:31.319 --> 00:34:38.372
and that my lucky appearancesaved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets insearch of a best man. 

511
00:34:38.372 --> 00:34:44.649
The bride gave me a sovereign, and I meanto wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion."

512
00:34:44.759 --> 00:34:49.148
"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; 

513
00:34:49.148 --> 00:34:50.637
"and whatthen?"

514
00:34:50.707 --> 00:34:54.769
"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. 

515
00:34:54.768 --> 00:34:58.478
It looked as ifthe pair might take an immediate departure, 

516
00:34:58.478 --> 00:35:03.136
and so necessitatevery prompt and energetic measures on my part. 

517
00:35:03.311 --> 00:35:06.497
At the churchdoor, however, they separated, 

518
00:35:06.497 --> 00:35:08.740
he driving back to the Temple, 

519
00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:11.038
andshe to her own house. 

520
00:35:11.038 --> 00:35:16.694
'I shall drive out in the park at five asusual,' she said as she left him. 

521
00:35:16.694 --> 00:35:18.222
I heard no more. 

522
00:35:18.222 --> 00:35:23.629
They droveaway in different directions, and I went off to make my ownarrangements."

523
00:35:23.647 --> 00:35:30.343
"Which are?""Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he answered, ringing thebell. 

524
00:35:30.544 --> 00:35:33.273
"I have been too busy to think of food, 

525
00:35:33.273 --> 00:35:36.330
and I am likely tobe busier still this evening. 

526
00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:40.518
By the way, Doctor, I shall wantyour co-operation."

527
00:35:40.666 --> 00:35:42.895
"I shall be delighted."

528
00:35:42.991 --> 00:35:45.794
"You don't mind breaking the law?"

529
00:35:45.995 --> 00:35:48.006
"Not in the least."

530
00:35:48.006 --> 00:35:50.932
"Nor running a chance of arrest?"

531
00:35:50.932 --> 00:35:53.257
"Not in a good cause."

532
00:35:53.257 --> 00:35:56.209
"Oh, the cause is excellent!"

533
00:35:56.209 --> 00:35:58.168
"Then I am your man."

534
00:35:58.168 --> 00:36:01.337
"I was sure that I might rely on you."

535
00:36:01.642 --> 00:36:04.054
"But what is it you wish?"

536
00:36:04.699 --> 00:36:08.970
"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear toyou. 

537
00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:15.091
Now," he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare thatour landlady had provided, 

538
00:36:15.091 --> 00:36:19.414
"I must discuss it while I eat, for Ihave not much time. 

539
00:36:19.414 --> 00:36:21.543
It is nearly five now. 

540
00:36:21.543 --> 00:36:25.122
In two hours we mustbe on the scene of action. 

541
00:36:25.122 --> 00:36:30.385
Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returnsfrom her drive at seven. 

542
00:36:30.385 --> 00:36:33.476
We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."

543
00:36:33.559 --> 00:36:35.518
"And what then?"

544
00:36:35.719 --> 00:36:41.056
"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is tooccur. 

545
00:36:41.056 --> 00:36:44.269
There is only one point on which I must insist. 

546
00:36:44.269 --> 00:36:48.875
You mustnot interfere, come what may. You understand?"

547
00:36:49.024 --> 00:36:51.357
"I am to be neutral?"

548
00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:53.660
"To do nothing whatever. 

549
00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:57.644
There will probably be some smallunpleasantness. 

550
00:36:57.644 --> 00:36:59.355
Do not join in it. 

551
00:36:59.355 --> 00:37:02.738
It will end in my beingconveyed into the house. 

552
00:37:02.738 --> 00:37:07.022
Four or five minutes afterwards thesitting-room window will open. 

553
00:37:07.022 --> 00:37:10.661
You are to station yourself closeto that open window."

554
00:37:10.679 --> 00:37:15.703
"Yes.""You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you."

555
00:37:15.799 --> 00:37:20.005
"Yes.""And when I raise my hand -- so 

556
00:37:20.005 --> 00:37:23.179
-- you will throw into the room whatI give you to throw, 

557
00:37:23.179 --> 00:37:27.554
and will, at the same time, raise the cry offire. 

558
00:37:27.554 --> 00:37:30.984
You quite follow me?""Entirely."

559
00:37:31.029 --> 00:37:33.641
"It is nothing very formidable," 

560
00:37:33.641 --> 00:37:37.802
he said, taking a long cigar-shapedroll from his pocket. 

561
00:37:37.898 --> 00:37:44.568
"It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket,fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting.

562
00:37:44.568 --> 00:37:47.245
Your task is confined to that. 

563
00:37:47.245 --> 00:37:52.378
When you raise your cry of fire,it will be taken up by quite a number of people. 

564
00:37:52.378 --> 00:37:57.211
You may thenwalk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in tenminutes. 

565
00:37:57.211 --> 00:37:59.936
I hope that I have made myself clear?"

566
00:38:00.286 --> 00:38:02.872
"I am to remain neutral, 

567
00:38:02.872 --> 00:38:06.059
to get near the window, to watch you,

568
00:38:06.059 --> 00:38:08.984
and at the signal to throw in this object, 

569
00:38:08.984 --> 00:38:11.780
then to raise the cryof fire, 

570
00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:14.496
and to wait you at the corner of the street."

571
00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:19.355
"Precisely.""Then you may entirely rely on me."

572
00:38:19.433 --> 00:38:21.549
"That is excellent. 

573
00:38:21.549 --> 00:38:26.860
I think, perhaps, it is almost time that Iprepare for the new role I have to play."

574
00:38:27.688 --> 00:38:31.763
He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes 

575
00:38:31.763 --> 00:38:36.896
inthe character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformistclergyman. 

576
00:38:36.896 --> 00:38:40.684
His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, 

577
00:38:40.684 --> 00:38:44.041
his whitetie, his sympathetic smile, 

578
00:38:44.041 --> 00:38:47.933
and general look of peering andbenevolent curiosity 

579
00:38:47.933 --> 00:38:51.499
were such as Mr. John Hare alone could haveequalled. 

580
00:38:51.499 --> 00:38:55.051
It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. 

581
00:38:55.051 --> 00:38:57.611
Hisexpression, his manner, 

582
00:38:57.611 --> 00:39:02.131
his very soul seemed to vary with everyfresh part that he assumed. 

583
00:39:02.131 --> 00:39:05.095
The stage lost a fine actor, 

584
00:39:05.095 --> 00:39:10.250
even asscience lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist incrime.

585
00:39:11.078 --> 00:39:14.813
It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, 

586
00:39:14.813 --> 00:39:20.103
and it stillwanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves inSerpentine Avenue. 

587
00:39:20.103 --> 00:39:22.284
It was already dusk, 

588
00:39:22.284 --> 00:39:27.587
and the lamps were justbeing lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge,

589
00:39:27.587 --> 00:39:30.103
waiting for the coming of its occupant. 

590
00:39:30.121 --> 00:39:36.246
The house was just suchas I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description,

591
00:39:36.246 --> 00:39:40.486
but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. 

592
00:39:40.486 --> 00:39:47.109
Onthe contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it wasremarkably animated. 

593
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:51.453
There was a group of shabbily dressed mensmoking and laughing in a corner, 

594
00:39:51.523 --> 00:39:54.096
a scissors-grinder with hiswheel, 

595
00:39:54.096 --> 00:39:57.074
two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, 

596
00:39:57.074 --> 00:40:02.882
andseveral well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down withcigars in their mouths.

597
00:40:02.957 --> 00:40:08.886
"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front ofthe house, 

598
00:40:08.886 --> 00:40:12.021
"this marriage rather simplifies matters. 

599
00:40:12.021 --> 00:40:15.530
Thephotograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. 

600
00:40:15.548 --> 00:40:21.451
The chances arethat she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. GodfreyNorton, 

601
00:40:21.451 --> 00:40:25.670
as our client is to its coming to the eyes of hisprincess. 

602
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:27.616
Now the question is, 

603
00:40:27.616 --> 00:40:30.785
Where are we to find thephotograph?"

604
00:40:30.855 --> 00:40:32.841
"Where, indeed?"

605
00:40:32.989 --> 00:40:36.803
"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. 

606
00:40:36.803 --> 00:40:39.167
It iscabinet size. 

607
00:40:39.167 --> 00:40:43.112
Too large for easy concealment about a woman'sdress. 

608
00:40:43.112 --> 00:40:47.513
She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaidand searched. 

609
00:40:47.513 --> 00:40:50.813
Two attempts of the sort have already been made. 

610
00:40:50.813 --> 00:40:55.001
Wemay take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her."

611
00:40:55.306 --> 00:40:59.486
"Where, then?""Her banker or her lawyer. 

612
00:40:59.486 --> 00:41:02.263
There is that double possibility. 

613
00:41:02.333 --> 00:41:05.755
ButI am inclined to think neither. 

614
00:41:05.755 --> 00:41:08.184
Women are naturally secretive,

615
00:41:08.184 --> 00:41:10.640
and they like to do their own secreting. 

616
00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:14.036
Why should she hand itover to anyone else? 

617
00:41:14.036 --> 00:41:16.413
She could trust her own guardianship, 

618
00:41:16.413 --> 00:41:23.161
butshe could not tell what indirect or political influence might bebrought to bear upon a business man. 

619
00:41:23.205 --> 00:41:28.651
Besides, remember that shehad resolved to use it within a few days. 

620
00:41:28.651 --> 00:41:31.825
It must be where shecan lay her hands upon it. 

621
00:41:31.825 --> 00:41:34.438
It must be in her own house."

622
00:41:34.438 --> 00:41:37.193
"But it has twice been burgled."

623
00:41:37.193 --> 00:41:41.277
"Pshaw! They did not know how to look."

624
00:41:41.582 --> 00:41:46.023
"But how will you look?""I will not look."

625
00:41:46.023 --> 00:41:50.438
"What then?""I will get her to show me."

626
00:41:50.438 --> 00:41:53.285
"But she will refuse."

627
00:41:53.285 --> 00:41:55.610
"She will not be able to. 

628
00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:58.784
But I hear the rumble of wheels. 

629
00:41:58.784 --> 00:42:00.273
It isher carriage. 

630
00:42:00.273 --> 00:42:03.755
Now carry out my orders to the letter."

631
00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:10.160
As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came roundthe curve of the avenue. 

632
00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:15.437
It was a smart little landau whichrattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. 

633
00:42:15.437 --> 00:42:17.069
As it pulled up, 

634
00:42:17.069 --> 00:42:22.372
one ofthe loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door inthe hope of earning a copper, 

635
00:42:22.372 --> 00:42:27.492
but was elbowed away by anotherloafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. 

636
00:42:27.492 --> 00:42:29.542
A fiercequarrel broke out, 

637
00:42:29.542 --> 00:42:31.880
which was increased by the two guardsmen, 

638
00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.505
whotook sides with one of the loungers, 

639
00:42:34.505 --> 00:42:39.338
and by the scissors-grinder,who was equally hot upon the other side. 

640
00:42:39.408 --> 00:42:43.092
A blow was struck, andin an instant the lady, 

641
00:42:43.092 --> 00:42:45.099
who had stepped from her carriage, 

642
00:42:45.099 --> 00:42:48.913
wasthe centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, 

643
00:42:48.913 --> 00:42:53.249
whostruck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. 

644
00:42:53.249 --> 00:42:56.423
Holmesdashed into the crowd to protect the lady; 

645
00:42:56.422 --> 00:42:58.709
but, just as he reachedher, 

646
00:42:58.709 --> 00:43:03.685
he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the bloodrunning freely down his face. 

647
00:43:03.685 --> 00:43:07.669
At his fall the guardsmen took totheir heels in one direction 

648
00:43:07.669 --> 00:43:09.536
and the loungers in the other, 

649
00:43:09.536 --> 00:43:14.643
whilea number of better dressed people, who had watched the scufflewithout taking part in it, 

650
00:43:14.643 --> 00:43:18.883
crowded in to help the lady and toattend to the injured man. 

651
00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:22.384
Irene Adler, as I will still call her,

652
00:43:22.428 --> 00:43:24.700
had hurried up the steps; 

653
00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:30.369
but she stood at the top with hersuperb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, 

654
00:43:30.369 --> 00:43:32.780
lookingback into the street.

655
00:43:33.086 --> 00:43:37.195
"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked.

656
00:43:37.213 --> 00:43:40.726
"He is dead," cried several voices.

657
00:43:40.726 --> 00:43:45.050
"No, no, there's life in him!" shouted another. 

658
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:48.506
"But he'll begone before you can get him to hospital."

659
00:43:48.968 --> 00:43:52.024
"He's a brave fellow," said a woman. 

660
00:43:52.024 --> 00:43:56.412
"They would have had thelady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. 

661
00:43:56.411 --> 00:43:59.626
They were agang, and a rough one, too. 

662
00:43:59.626 --> 00:44:02.142
Ah, he's breathing now."

663
00:44:02.369 --> 00:44:06.740
"He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?"

664
00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:10.232
"Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. 

665
00:44:10.232 --> 00:44:13.897
There is a comfortablesofa. This way, please!"

666
00:44:13.993 --> 00:44:20.289
Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid outin the principal room, 

667
00:44:20.289 --> 00:44:24.429
while I still observed the proceedingsfrom my post by the window. 

668
00:44:24.429 --> 00:44:28.491
The lamps had been lit, but theblinds had not been drawn, 

669
00:44:28.491 --> 00:44:31.926
so that I could see Holmes as he layupon the couch. 

670
00:44:31.971 --> 00:44:37.313
I do not know whether he was seized withcompunction at that moment for the part he was playing, 

671
00:44:37.313 --> 00:44:42.180
but Iknow that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life

672
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:46.307
than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I wasconspiring, 

673
00:44:46.307 --> 00:44:51.636
or the grace and kindliness with which she waitedupon the injured man. 

674
00:44:51.636 --> 00:44:59.219
And yet it would be the blackest treacheryto Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrustedto me. 

675
00:44:59.237 --> 00:45:04.044
I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from undermy ulster. 

676
00:45:04.044 --> 00:45:07.779
After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. 

677
00:45:07.779 --> 00:45:11.393
We arebut preventing her from injuring another.

678
00:45:11.393 --> 00:45:14.180
Holmes had sat up upon the couch, 

679
00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:17.740
and I saw him motion like a manwho is in need of air. 

680
00:45:17.811 --> 00:45:21.089
A maid rushed across and threw open thewindow. 

681
00:45:21.089 --> 00:45:29.095
At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at thesignal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of "Fire!" 

682
00:45:29.113 --> 00:45:35.749
Theword was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd ofspectators, well dressed and ill 

683
00:45:35.749 --> 00:45:42.104
-- gentlemen, ostlers, andservant maids -- joined in a general shriek of "Fire!" 

684
00:45:42.175 --> 00:45:46.981
Thick cloudsof smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. 

685
00:45:46.981 --> 00:45:49.549
Icaught a glimpse of rushing figures, 

686
00:45:49.549 --> 00:45:52.488
and a moment later the voiceof Holmes from within 

687
00:45:52.488 --> 00:45:55.975
assuring them that it was a false alarm.

688
00:45:56.020 --> 00:46:00.852
Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the cornerof the street, 

689
00:46:00.852 --> 00:46:05.353
and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find myfriend's arm in mine, 

690
00:46:05.353 --> 00:46:07.739
and to get away from the scene of uproar.

691
00:46:07.913 --> 00:46:16.490
He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until wehad turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards theEdgeware Road.

692
00:46:16.978 --> 00:46:21.053
"You did it very nicely, Doctor," he remarked. 

693
00:46:21.053 --> 00:46:24.718
"Nothing couldhave been better. It is all right."

694
00:46:24.893 --> 00:46:27.153
"You have the photograph?"

695
00:46:27.153 --> 00:46:29.517
"I know where it is."

696
00:46:29.517 --> 00:46:32.085
"And how did you find out?"

697
00:46:32.103 --> 00:46:35.708
"She showed me, as I told you she would."

698
00:46:35.726 --> 00:46:38.451
"I am still in the dark."

699
00:46:38.704 --> 00:46:43.066
"I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing. 

700
00:46:43.066 --> 00:46:45.300
"The matterwas perfectly simple. 

701
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:49.709
You, of course, saw that everyone in thestreet was an accomplice. 

702
00:46:49.709 --> 00:46:52.172
They were all engaged for the evening."

703
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:54.306
"I guessed as much."

704
00:46:54.306 --> 00:46:56.449
"Then, when the row broke out, 

705
00:46:56.449 --> 00:46:59.831
I had a little moist red paint inthe palm of my hand. 

706
00:46:59.831 --> 00:47:01.961
I rushed forward, fell down, 

707
00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:05.827
clapped my handto my face, and became a piteous spectacle. 

708
00:47:05.827 --> 00:47:07.917
It is an old trick."

709
00:47:07.917 --> 00:47:10.433
"That also I could fathom."

710
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:13.050
"Then they carried me in. 

711
00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:16.785
She was bound to have me in. What elsecould she do? 

712
00:47:16.785 --> 00:47:18.692
And into her sitting-room, 

713
00:47:18.692 --> 00:47:21.566
which was the very roomwhich I suspected. 

714
00:47:21.566 --> 00:47:23.982
It lay between that and her bedroom, 

715
00:47:23.982 --> 00:47:26.411
and I wasdetermined to see which. 

716
00:47:26.411 --> 00:47:29.912
They laid me on a couch, I motioned forair, 

717
00:47:29.912 --> 00:47:34.535
they were compelled to open the window, and you had yourchance."

718
00:47:34.535 --> 00:47:36.711
"How did that help you?"

719
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:39.119
"It was all-important. 

720
00:47:39.119 --> 00:47:41.979
When a woman thinks that her house is onfire, 

721
00:47:41.979 --> 00:47:46.799
her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which shevalues most. 

722
00:47:46.799 --> 00:47:50.025
It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, 

723
00:47:50.025 --> 00:47:52.768
and I havemore than once taken advantage of it. 

724
00:47:52.768 --> 00:47:57.509
In the case of theDarlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, 

725
00:47:57.509 --> 00:48:00.526
and also inthe Arnsworth Castle business. 

726
00:48:00.526 --> 00:48:02.838
A married woman grabs at her baby;

727
00:48:02.838 --> 00:48:06.273
an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. 

728
00:48:06.273 --> 00:48:12.335
Now it was clear tome that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more preciousto her 

729
00:48:12.335 --> 00:48:14.947
than what we are in quest of. 

730
00:48:14.947 --> 00:48:17.063
She would rush to secure it.

731
00:48:17.063 --> 00:48:20.002
The alarm of fire was admirably done. 

732
00:48:20.002 --> 00:48:23.685
The smoke and shouting wereenough to shake nerves of steel. 

733
00:48:23.685 --> 00:48:25.866
She responded beautifully. 

734
00:48:25.866 --> 00:48:31.935
Thephotograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above theright bell-pull. 

735
00:48:31.953 --> 00:48:34.121
She was there in an instant, 

736
00:48:34.121 --> 00:48:37.373
and I caught aglimpse of it as she half drew it out. 

737
00:48:37.373 --> 00:48:40.181
When I cried out that itwas a false alarm, 

738
00:48:40.181 --> 00:48:43.172
she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, 

739
00:48:43.172 --> 00:48:46.620
rushedfrom the room, and I have not seen her since. 

740
00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:51.283
I rose, and, makingmy excuses, escaped from the house. 

741
00:48:51.283 --> 00:48:55.463
I hesitated whether toattempt to secure the photograph at once; 

742
00:48:55.463 --> 00:49:01.131
but the coachman hadcome in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer towait. 

743
00:49:01.131 --> 00:49:04.562
A little over-precipitance may ruin all."

744
00:49:05.154 --> 00:49:08.166
"And now?" I asked.

745
00:49:08.237 --> 00:49:10.914
"Our quest is practically finished. 

746
00:49:10.914 --> 00:49:16.113
I shall call with the Kingto-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. 

747
00:49:16.113 --> 00:49:19.430
We will beshown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, 

748
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:25.255
but it isprobable that when she comes she may find neither us nor thephotograph. 

749
00:49:25.255 --> 00:49:28.116
It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty 

750
00:49:28.116 --> 00:49:30.893
to regainit with his own hands."

751
00:49:30.963 --> 00:49:33.453
"And when will you call?"

752
00:49:33.602 --> 00:49:35.626
"At eight in the morning. 

753
00:49:35.626 --> 00:49:39.414
She will not be up, so that we shallhave a clear field. 

754
00:49:39.414 --> 00:49:41.647
Besides, we must be prompt, 

755
00:49:41.647 --> 00:49:45.801
for this marriagemay mean a complete change in her life and habits. 

756
00:49:45.801 --> 00:49:48.709
I must wire tothe King without delay."

757
00:49:49.353 --> 00:49:52.775
We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. 

758
00:49:52.775 --> 00:49:57.556
He wassearching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:

759
00:49:57.556 --> 00:50:00.359
"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."

760
00:50:00.377 --> 00:50:03.590
There were several people on the pavement at the time, 

761
00:50:03.590 --> 00:50:08.692
but thegreeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who hadhurried by.

762
00:50:08.945 --> 00:50:11.644
"I've heard that voice before," 

763
00:50:11.662 --> 00:50:15.241
said Holmes, staring down thedimly lit street. 

764
00:50:15.241 --> 00:50:18.671
"Now, I wonder who the deuce that could havebeen."

765
00:50:19.864 --> 00:50:21.615
III.

766
00:50:22.372 --> 00:50:25.324
I slept at Baker Street that night, 

767
00:50:25.324 --> 00:50:28.615
and we were engaged upon ourtoast and coffee in the morning 

768
00:50:28.615 --> 00:50:31.523
when the King of Bohemia rushedinto the room.

769
00:50:31.672 --> 00:50:33.696
"You have really got it!" 

770
00:50:33.696 --> 00:50:36.975
he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes byeither shoulder 

771
00:50:36.975 --> 00:50:39.456
and looking eagerly into his face.

772
00:50:39.456 --> 00:50:42.944
"Not yet.""But you have hopes?"

773
00:50:42.944 --> 00:50:44.746
"I have hopes."

774
00:50:44.746 --> 00:50:48.542
"Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone."

775
00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:52.695
"We must have a cab.""No, my brougham is waiting."

776
00:50:52.713 --> 00:50:55.430
"Then that will simplify matters." 

777
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:59.853
We descended and started offonce more for Briony Lodge.

778
00:51:00.198 --> 00:51:04.586
"Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.

779
00:51:04.586 --> 00:51:06.606
"Married! When?"

780
00:51:06.728 --> 00:51:10.237
"Yesterday.""But to whom?"

781
00:51:10.411 --> 00:51:13.293
"To an English lawyer named Norton."

782
00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:16.245
"But she could not love him."

783
00:51:16.263 --> 00:51:18.953
"I am in hopes that she does."

784
00:51:18.953 --> 00:51:21.417
"And why in hopes?"

785
00:51:21.513 --> 00:51:26.242
"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of futureannoyance. 

786
00:51:26.242 --> 00:51:28.423
If the lady loves her husband, 

787
00:51:28.423 --> 00:51:30.591
she does not love yourMajesty. 

788
00:51:30.591 --> 00:51:36.660
If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reasonwhy she should interfere with your Majesty's plan."

789
00:51:37.056 --> 00:51:40.165
"It is true. And yet -- ! Well! 

790
00:51:40.165 --> 00:51:42.855
I wish she had been of my ownstation! 

791
00:51:42.855 --> 00:51:45.633
What a queen she would have made!" 

792
00:51:45.886 --> 00:51:51.842
He relapsed into amoody silence, which was not broken until we drew up inSerpentine Avenue.

793
00:51:52.304 --> 00:51:57.737
The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stoodupon the steps. 

794
00:51:57.737 --> 00:52:01.742
She watched us with a sardonic eye as we steppedfrom the brougham.

795
00:52:02.204 --> 00:52:06.366
"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.

796
00:52:06.653 --> 00:52:10.284
"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, 

797
00:52:10.284 --> 00:52:13.975
looking at her with aquestioning and rather startled gaze.

798
00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:18.513
"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. 

799
00:52:18.513 --> 00:52:24.717
Sheleft this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from CharingCross for the Continent."

800
00:52:24.717 --> 00:52:30.555
"What!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin andsurprise. 

801
00:52:30.555 --> 00:52:33.593
"Do you mean that she has left England?"

802
00:52:33.664 --> 00:52:35.701
"Never to return."

803
00:52:35.989 --> 00:52:39.881
"And the papers?" asked the King hoarsely. 

804
00:52:39.881 --> 00:52:43.885
"All is lost.""We shall see." 

805
00:52:44.138 --> 00:52:47.404
He pushed past the servant and rushed into thedrawing-room, 

806
00:52:47.404 --> 00:52:49.572
followed by the King and myself. 

807
00:52:49.572 --> 00:52:52.785
The furniture wasscattered about in every direction, 

808
00:52:52.785 --> 00:52:55.554
with dismantled shelves andopen drawers, 

809
00:52:55.554 --> 00:52:59.433
as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them beforeher flight. 

810
00:52:59.433 --> 00:53:01.509
Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, 

811
00:53:01.509 --> 00:53:03.992
tore back a smallsliding shutter, 

812
00:53:03.992 --> 00:53:08.362
and, plunging in his hand, pulled out aphotograph and a letter. 

813
00:53:08.485 --> 00:53:12.939
The photograph was of Irene Adlerherself in evening dress, 

814
00:53:12.939 --> 00:53:14.911
the letter was superscribed to

815
00:53:14.911 --> 00:53:19.151
"Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for." 

816
00:53:19.352 --> 00:53:23.806
My friendtore it open, and we all three read it together. 

817
00:53:23.806 --> 00:53:28.594
It was dated atmidnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:

818
00:53:28.978 --> 00:53:32.204
"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES, 

819
00:53:32.204 --> 00:53:34.451
-- You really did it very well. 

820
00:53:34.451 --> 00:53:36.762
Youtook me in completely. 

821
00:53:36.762 --> 00:53:40.446
Until after the alarm of fire, I had not asuspicion. 

822
00:53:40.446 --> 00:53:43.959
But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, 

823
00:53:43.959 --> 00:53:45.918
Ibegan to think. 

824
00:53:45.918 --> 00:53:48.687
I had been warned against you months ago. 

825
00:53:48.687 --> 00:53:50.411
I hadbeen told that, 

826
00:53:50.411 --> 00:53:53.972
if the King employed an agent, it would certainlybe you. 

827
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:56.733
And your address had been given me. 

828
00:53:56.733 --> 00:54:01.260
Yet, with all this,you made me reveal what you wanted to know. 

829
00:54:01.278 --> 00:54:03.943
Even after I becamesuspicious, 

830
00:54:03.943 --> 00:54:08.888
I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kindold clergyman. 

831
00:54:08.958 --> 00:54:13.251
But, you know, I have been trained as an actressmyself. 

832
00:54:13.269 --> 00:54:15.881
Male costume is nothing new to me. 

833
00:54:15.881 --> 00:54:19.211
I often take advantageof the freedom which it gives. 

834
00:54:19.211 --> 00:54:22.281
I sent John, the coachman, towatch you, 

835
00:54:22.281 --> 00:54:26.591
ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I callthem, 

836
00:54:26.591 --> 00:54:29.420
and came down just as you departed.

837
00:54:29.882 --> 00:54:32.743
"Well, I followed you to your door, 

838
00:54:32.743 --> 00:54:39.156
and so made sure that I wasreally an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. SherlockHolmes. 

839
00:54:39.156 --> 00:54:41.873
Then I, rather imprudently, 

840
00:54:41.873 --> 00:54:46.165
wished you good-night, andstarted for the Temple to see my husband.

841
00:54:46.235 --> 00:54:49.265
"We both thought thebest resource was flight, 

842
00:54:49.265 --> 00:54:52.609
when pursued by so formidable anantagonist; 

843
00:54:52.609 --> 00:54:56.169
so you will find the nest empty when you callto-morrow. 

844
00:54:56.266 --> 00:55:00.341
As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. 

845
00:55:00.341 --> 00:55:04.137
Ilove and am loved by a better man than he. 

846
00:55:04.311 --> 00:55:09.152
The King may do whathe will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. 

847
00:55:09.405 --> 00:55:12.239
Ikeep it only to safeguard myself, 

848
00:55:12.239 --> 00:55:16.615
and to preserve a weapon whichwill always secure me from any steps 

849
00:55:16.615 --> 00:55:18.692
which he might take in thefuture. 

850
00:55:18.867 --> 00:55:22.550
I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; 

851
00:55:22.550 --> 00:55:25.628
andI remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,

852
00:55:25.628 --> 00:55:30.939
"Very truly yours,"IRENE NORTON, née ADLER."

853
00:55:31.923 --> 00:55:35.345
"What a woman -- oh, what a woman!" 

854
00:55:35.345 --> 00:55:39.825
cried the King of Bohemia, whenwe had all three read this epistle. 

855
00:55:39.825 --> 00:55:43.731
"Did I not tell you how quickand resolute she was? 

856
00:55:43.731 --> 00:55:46.709
Would she not have made an admirable queen?

857
00:55:46.709 --> 00:55:50.322
Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"

858
00:55:50.731 --> 00:55:54.493
"From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, 

859
00:55:54.493 --> 00:55:57.510
to be on avery different level to your Majesty," 

860
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:59.530
said Holmes coldly. 

861
00:55:59.548 --> 00:56:05.851
"I amsorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's businessto a more successful conclusion."

862
00:56:06.118 --> 00:56:10.140
"On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the King; 

863
00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:12.661
"nothing could bemore successful. 

864
00:56:12.661 --> 00:56:15.286
I know that her word is inviolate. 

865
00:56:15.286 --> 00:56:18.926
Thephotograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."

866
00:56:19.257 --> 00:56:23.131
"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so."

867
00:56:23.463 --> 00:56:26.428
"I am immensely indebted to you. 

868
00:56:26.428 --> 00:56:29.654
Pray tell me in what way I canreward you. 

869
00:56:29.654 --> 00:56:36.767
This ring -- " He slipped an emerald snake ring fromhis finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.

870
00:56:36.838 --> 00:56:42.793
"Your Majesty has something which I should value even morehighly," said Holmes.

871
00:56:42.793 --> 00:56:45.048
"You have but to name it."

872
00:56:45.092 --> 00:56:47.060
"This photograph!"

873
00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:49.873
The King stared in amazement.

874
00:56:49.873 --> 00:56:53.007
"Irene's photograph!" he cried. 

875
00:56:53.007 --> 00:56:55.340
"Certainly, if you wish it."

876
00:56:55.437 --> 00:56:57.526
"I thank your Majesty. 

877
00:56:57.526 --> 00:57:00.269
Then there is no more to be done in thematter. 

878
00:57:00.269 --> 00:57:04.170
I have the honour to wish you a very good morning." 

879
00:57:04.632 --> 00:57:09.974
Hebowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which theKing had stretched out to him, 

880
00:57:09.974 --> 00:57:13.187
he set off in my company for hischambers.

881
00:57:13.187 --> 00:57:18.398
And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdomof Bohemia, 

882
00:57:18.398 --> 00:57:21.873
and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes 

883
00:57:21.873 --> 00:57:24.493
werebeaten by a woman's wit. 

884
00:57:24.563 --> 00:57:27.802
He used to make merry over thecleverness of women, 

885
00:57:27.802 --> 00:57:30.570
but I have not heard him do it of late. 

886
00:57:30.570 --> 00:57:32.908
Andwhen he speaks of Irene Adler, 

887
00:57:32.908 --> 00:57:35.586
or when he refers to herphotograph, 

888
00:57:35.586 --> 00:57:40.087
it is always under the honourable title of the woman.

889
00:57:42.169 --> 00:57:45.677
End of Chapter 1.
